When walking, you should move at a moderate to fast pace, not a leisurely one. Being an activity of lower intensity, walking doesnâ€™t burn as many calories as some other activities, but still provides great benefit. A 150 lb person will burn about 175 calories walking 4 miles per hour for 30 minutes, compared to 450 calories running twice as fast. Maintain proper posture as you walk, and only hold onto the handles when necessary, such as when dismounting or checking your heart rate. ",
